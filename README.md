# Crossword-with-Friends
We took inspiration from two popular games, Words with Friends, where one plays Scrabble against another player while being able to talk to that player, and Taboo, where one has to get their teammates to guess a word without explicitly using that word, to create our final project, "Crosswords with Friends". The aim of the game is to fill out the crossword puzzle with the help of your partner. One of you will be given the across clues but only allowed to fill in the down answers and the other will be given the down clues but only allowed to fill the across answers, and players are not allowed to explicitly say the clues in the chatroom. You will have to communicate with your partner to 1). relay the meaning of the clue to your partner, without saying the clue, and then 2). figure out the answer to the clue.
